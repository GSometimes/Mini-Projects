    <h1>An Ode to Cayde-6...</h1>
    <p>I’d like to start buy quoting a fellow Exo of Cayde’s, Banshee-44, “…Cayde, never forget Cayde. Hunter through and through…” Cayde was the Hunter Vanguard in Destiny. He was, and still is, an icon within the community regardless of what class you main and he brought countless laughs, memorable moments, and tears with his tragic, heroic end that no Guardian will ever forget. Cayde was a hunter that always longed for combat. You would sometimes catch him saying things like “I need to get back in the field,” or even whispering to you to try and get you to take him on a mission. He was a gambler, and a skilled hunter. Cayde was oftentimes facetious and makes flippant remarks, even in the face of his own death. However, when aggravated, he abandons his carefree demeanor and becomes more thoughtful and even vengeful.</p>
